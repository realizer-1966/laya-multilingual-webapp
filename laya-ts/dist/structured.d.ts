/**
 * Schema-driven decisions: turn a JSON schema into Laya questions.
 *
 * Port of `laya/structured.py` (#280). Provider-free. The mapping is a documented subset:
 * an object of properties, each an enum choice, a boolean, or a bounded integer scale.
 * Anything that cannot be answered from a fixed option set (free strings, arrays, nested
 * objects, $ref) is rejected with a SchemaError that names the path.
 *
 *     const values = await agent.decide(state, {
 *       type: "object",
 *       properties: {
 *         department: { type: "string", enum: ["billing", "support", "sales"] },
 *         urgency: { type: "integer", minimum: 0, maximum: 2 },
 *         needs_human: { type: "boolean" },
 *       },
 *     });
 *
 * Zod/TypeBox users can pass their schema's JSON form (`z.toJSONSchema(Model)`); anything
 * with a `toJSONSchema()` method is accepted.
